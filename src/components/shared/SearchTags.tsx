//TODO: PNeededSometime
//Input Box
//Takes in an array of columns
//After debounce delay searches for that value in the DB (Do we need to know the datatype to build the filter correctly?)
//Shows a drop down list of those values (ala google prompts, but with the column name it came from as well)
//If the user selects/clicks on an item it is added as a tag so they can 'x' it out
